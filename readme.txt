# CleanTech: Transforming Waste Management with Transfer Learning

CleanTech is a smart AI-powered solution that classifies waste into three categories: **Biodegradable**, **Recyclable**, and **Trash**. Using deep learning and transfer learning techniques, this project aims to promote environmental awareness and encourage responsible waste disposal.

## 🌱 Features

- 🌍 Classifies waste into 3 categories using a trained TensorFlow model
- 📷 Image upload interface for real-time predictions
- 🧠 Built with a custom CNN model using transfer learning
- 💬 Integrated chatbot for user engagement (optional)
- 🖥️ Flask-based web interface for smooth interaction

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Render / Localhost / (Optional: ngrok)

## 📁 Dataset

We used a curated dataset of images representing:
- Biodegradable items (like food waste)
- Recyclable items (plastic bottles, paper, etc.)
- General trash

The dataset was split into training and testing sets and preprocessed to match model input requirements.

# CleanTech: Transforming Waste Management with Transfer Learning ♻️

CleanTech is an AI-powered web application that classifies waste images into three categories — **Biodegradable**, **Recyclable**, and **Trash** — using deep learning and transfer learning. The goal is to encourage smart and sustainable waste segregation through intelligent classification.

## 🔍 Features

- 🧠 **Transfer Learning** with pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet)
- 📦 Predicts waste type from uploaded images
- 🌐 Built using **Flask**, **TensorFlow**, and **HTML/CSS**
- 🖼️ Real-time image upload and preview
- 📊 Clean UI with smooth prediction flow

## 📁 Dataset

We used a custom image dataset consisting of:
- **Biodegradable** images (organic, compostable materials)
- **Recyclable** images (plastic, metal, paper)
- **Trash** images (non-recyclable, mixed waste)

> 📸 Images were preprocessed and resized to 224x224 before training.
